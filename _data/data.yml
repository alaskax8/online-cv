career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a highly motivated software engineer interested in the areas of Robotics, Automation, Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
      My passion for software already started at the age of twelve where I made my first steps in coding.
      During my studies at the Technical University of Munich I put a big focus on hands-on projects in robotics and machine learning. 
      In my current positon at CareX.ai I also built up an high interest in creating data pipelines and infrastructure for Machine Learning projects in Python.
